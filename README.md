CS540 Introduction to Artifical Intelligence Spring 2021

Homework 2 - Reads in a corpus (a collection of documents) with two possible labels and trains a classifier to determine which label a query document is more likely to have. The corpus is created from CS 540 essays about AI from 2016 and 2020 on the same topic. Based on training data from each, the classifer will predict whether the essay was written in 2020 or 2016. 

Homework 3 - Implements a facial analysis program using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using part of Yale face dataset.

Homework 4 - Performs clustering on publicly available Pokemon stats. Each Pokemon is defined by a row in the data set. Because there are various ways to characterize how strong a Pokemon is, it is often desirable to convert a raw stats sheet into a shorter feature vector. A Pokemon's strength is represented by two numbers: "x" and "y". "x" represents the Pokemon's total offensive strength, which is defined by Attack + Sp. Atk + Speed. Similarly, "y" represents the Pokemon's total defensive strength, which is defined by Defense + Sp. Def + HP. The first 20 Pokemon will be clustered with hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)

Homework 5 - Implements a linear regression calculation and examines the trends on a bodyfat dataset. 

Homework 6 - Performs some basic neural network tasks using Pytorch's utilities on the "hello world" dataset MNIST which consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Predicts labels of handwritten digits.

Homework 7 - A CNN model for MiniPlaces Dataset

Homework 9 -  Implements an efficient search algorithm (A* Search) on the 8-tile puzzle. It is played on a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles labeled 1 through 8 and an empty grid. Rearranges the tiles so that they are in order. 

Homework 10 - Uses the environment FrozenLake-v0 from OpenAI gym. Uses Q-learning and SARSA to win.
